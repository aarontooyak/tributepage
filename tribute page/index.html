                    <p>"His innovative compositions combined vocals and instruments, widening the scope of sonata, symphony,
                        concerto and quartet. He is the crucial transitional figure connecting the Classical and Romantic
                        ages of Western music...Summing up his life and imminent death during his last days, Beethoven, who
                        was never as eloquent with words as he was with music, borrowed a tagline that concluded many Latin
                        plays at the time. Plaudite, amici, comoedia finita est, he said. "Applaud friends, the comedy is
                        over.""</p>
